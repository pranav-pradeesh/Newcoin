# 🪙 __**NewCoin — A Simple Blockchain in C++**__

_NewCoin_ is an educational blockchain project written in **C++**. It demonstrates the core principles of blockchain technology including block mining, hashing, transactions, and wallet systems — all in a simple and modular way.

---

## __**🚀 Features**__

- ⛓️ **Blockchain Structure** with indexed blocks, hashes, and links  
- 🔐 **Wallet System** with pseudo key-pair generation  
- 💰 _Basic Transaction Model_ with sender, receiver, and amount  
- 🪙 **Proof-of-Work Mining** with adjustable difficulty  
- 🧾 _Command-line Output_ of blockchain data
